**Transaction Components:**
- **Nonce:** A count of transactions sent from a specific account; in Ethereum, it represents the number of transactions sent by the sender.
- **Gas Price:** The price per unit of gas in wei (the smallest denomination of Ether) that the sender is willing to pay.
- **Gas Limit:** The maximum amount of gas that can be consumed by the transaction.
- **To:** The address to which the transaction is being sent.
- **Value:** The amount of wei (Ether's smallest unit) to send along with the transaction.
- **Data:** Additional information or parameters to send to the recipient address.
- **V, R, S:** Components of the transaction signature used for authentication and validation.

**Reverting Transactions:**
```solidity
// Revert Example
revert("You need to send more ETH"); 
// This is equivalent to:
require(msg.value >= 1e18, "You need to send more ETH");
```
